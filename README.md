# Python

To run the python scripts first we need to setup a virtual environment and then install all the requirements using following python CLI command.

``pip install -r python_requirements.txt``

Once all the requirements are installed we need to edit the api_key in main.py and make proper changes to the operation we need to perform and run the script using:

``python python_sample/main.py``
